 * @brief The Contest class is a QML-friendly presentation of the data in a capnp UnsignedContest
 *
 * In addition to exposing the properties of ::UnsignedContest in a QML-accessible form, Contest provides storage for
 * two data::Decision objects: the Pending Decision and the Official Decision.
 *
 * The Pending Decision should be used by the GUI to store the user's currently selected opinions which have not yet
 * been committed to the blockchain. This property should always be populated with a Decision object, even if that
 * decision has no opinions, or just mirrors the Official Decision.
 *
 * The Official Decision should contain the decision currently on record (i.e. the newest one on the blockchain) for
 * the current user. If the user has not broadcast any decision to the blockchain, the Official Decision should be
 * nullptr.
